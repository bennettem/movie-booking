# movie-booking

Application uses localstorage to store movie,price, and seat data. A user is able to select only unoccupied seats. Based on how many seats a user picks 
both the seat count and the price will update. If the user selected too many seats they can simple click the seat(s) they no longer want and the count
and price will update accordingly. If the page refreshes localstorage stores the data and the user will be able to see where they left off.
